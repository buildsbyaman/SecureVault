## How It Works

### Encryption

1. Upload a file
2. Enter a passphrase
3. Download the encrypted file (with `_Encrypted` suffix)

1. Upload an encrypted file
2. Enter the same passphrase
3. Download the original file (with `_Decrypted` suffix)

> **Note**: Decryption only works with the correct passphrase.
